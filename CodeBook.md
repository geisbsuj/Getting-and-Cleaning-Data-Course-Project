# Content
the tidydata.txt contains 180 rows and 68 columns. Each row has averaged variables for each subject and each activity.

# Description of Data.
the columns containing -mean() = the mean value
the columns containing -std()= standard deviation

For each Record the following has ben measured:
* Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
* Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
* A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
* Its activity label.
* An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The data were averaged based on subject and activity group.
Subject column is numbered sequentially from 1 to 30. Activity column has 6 types as listed below:

WALKING
WALKING_UPSTAIRS
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
SITTING
STANDING
LAYING

# Definitions of Variables
activity_label = factor
subjec = integer
rest = numeric

# 66 variables of measurement (+ activity_label and subject)
